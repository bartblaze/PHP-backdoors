# PHP-backdoors
A collection of PHP backdoors. For educational and/or testing purposes only.


##### Notes
* The [deobfuscated folder](Deobfuscated) does not necessarily contain deobfuscated versions of the backdoors you can find in the [obfuscated folder](Obfuscated) . To deobfuscate those and other tricks, Check out the [PHP tools](PHP tools.md) section.
* Always investigate malware in a secure environment. This means: separately from your network and in a virtual machine!
* Some backdoors may be backdoored *(yes, really)*. Don't ever use this for any malicious purposes.
